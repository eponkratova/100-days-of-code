# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 13, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Finished clusters identification based on K-means.

**Thoughts:** Reading further and it might be the case that K-means is not the best way for a 1d data. I wonder if it is applicable to my case. Further reading is required.

### Day 2: September 14, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Was working with kernel density estimation as K-means seems to be over-kill for the 1D data. 

**Thoughts:** Angry with myself that it seems that I won't finish the piece today.
