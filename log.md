# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 13, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Finished clusters identification based on K-means.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
