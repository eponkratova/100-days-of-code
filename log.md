# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 13, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Finished clusters identification based on K-means.

**Thoughts:** Reading further and it might be the case that K-means is not the best way for a 1d data. I wonder if it is applicable to my case. Further reading is required.

### Day 2: September 14, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Was working with kernel density estimation as K-means seems to be over-kill for the 1D data. 

**Thoughts:** Angry with myself that it seems that I won't finish the piece today.

### Day 3: September 15, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the color division based on kernel density estimation, added the color break based on percentiles, finished jenks natural breaks optimization algorithm, build graphs to compare the results I have received so far of different algorthms used.

**Thoughts:** It was quit a productive morning. Managed to try a several ways to break the 1D data into intervals.

### Day 4: September 16, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Finished writing the function for the nested mean classification.

**Thoughts:** It's just a day 4. Well, I will definately have to revisit the function later on as it is extremelly sloppy, but it works and for day four, I am fine with the function being sloppy.

### Day 5: September 17, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Finished writing the function for the equal intervals method.

**Thoughts:** The function is somewhat ugly. Plus, it doesn't consider all the possibilities i.e. I was working with decimal numbers, but it could be whole, too, which the func doesn't take into account.

### Days 6-7: September 18-20, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Was working on geometric intervals. 

**Thoughts:** Such a waste of time in terms of real outputs. Put it aside as no progress was achieved.

### Day 8: September 21, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Finished with code cleaning and methods comparison.

**Thoughts:** Felt down at some poitn in the morning, but the more results I saw, the more motivation I had to continue.

### Day 9: September 22, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Finished with another course in the DataCamp 'Data Science track' on data viz.

**Thoughts:** No progress was made with any of the projects.

### Day 10: September 23, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Was reading on the genetic algorithm.

**Thoughts:** No progress was made with any of the projects.

### Day 11-15: September 24-28, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Done with d3 viz of the DEA

**Thoughts:** A bit depressed when looking at other's code...

### Day 16: September 29, 2018.

**Today's Progress**: Done with tweaking the code

**Thoughts:** Almost done with the project. What is left is a write-up and code cleaning. Actually happy.
